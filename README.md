# multiTracks
My first Multitracks Project. The project targets passing data to the details page  through the url and dynamically generating the page's content ( images and pictures). It also has an added API Project .

STEPS TO VIEW OR OPEN AN ARTIST'S DETAILS PAGE
-----------------------------------------------
1.  Load the project with VS (Visual studio).
2.  Test the Details page using the url. For example if you are using your local machine you will need to  visit:  localhost/artistDetails.aspx?artistID=2. This will automatically generate a details page for the artist with ID of 2.
3.  You may continue to test the page by changing the value of the ID to see how it dynamically generates the details of the Artist.
4.  The code was further refactored such that if a non-existing ID is entered, it redirects you to the Artist with ID of 1. (This is for development and test purposes).
